# typescript-webpack-react-redux-boilerplate
The goal of this repo is to help you start when combining Typescript with React and Redux.
LESS in combination of CSS modules is used for styling components. For running, building and bundling there is powerful Webpack.

## This boilerplate combines
* [Typescript 2](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
* [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
* [LESS](https://github.com/less/less.js)
* [CSS modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
* [Webpack 3](https://webpack.js.org/)
* [Tslint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/)

## Getting started
* run **npm install** to download dependencies
* run **npm start** to build and start webpack-dev-server
* open **http://localhost:3333/**

## Build options
* **npm run build** for single build (creates files and index.html in build/ folder)
* **npm start** to build and start webpack-dev-server
